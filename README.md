# anki-template-editor
An Anki (2.0) addon that adds fixed-width text and syntax highlighting to the card template editor

One drawback to the otherwise powerful Anki template editor is the absence of two common features of text editors:

1. fixed width (monospace) text
2. syntax highlighting

A common ad-hoc workaround was to copy & paste between the Anki template editor and a separate text editor. This addon provides these missing features directly in the template editor. Syntax highlighting works for both HTML and CSS, although currently the lexing is naive.

Example:

Next steps:

* configurable highlighting (colors, tokens)
* better syntax highlighting
* line numbers
* search & replace
* tabs to spaces
* automatic indentation
